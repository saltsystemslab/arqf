- [X] Implement `qf malloc`
- [X] Implement `qf_bulk_load` and `qf_iterator`
   - `qf_bulk_load`
    - `keepsake_add_bits(keepsake_slot_index, value, nbits, *keepsake_buffer, *keepsake_slot_offset)`
    - `keepsake_flush_bits(keepsake_slot_index, *keepsake_buffer, *keepsake_slot_offset)`
  - `qf_iterator`
- [X] Write verification functions/unit tests with above two
- [X] Implement point query 
- [X] Implement range query
- [ ] Optimize
- [X] Run benchmarks, check sanity - You should have a correct range filter now
- [X] Understand reverse hash map functionality 
- [X] Implement adaptivity.
  - [X] Fix adapt function
  - [X] Fix insert function (No common prefix within a quotient run)
- [X] Add warning if quotient + extension + memento exceeds 64 bits.
